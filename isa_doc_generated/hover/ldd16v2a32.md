* `ldd16v2a32 $aDst0, $mAddr0++, $mBase0, $mDelta0@`

Post-incrementing load of dense 16-bit delta-pair plus a sparse 32-bit
data value.

Destination register-file: ARF only

Effective addresses:

:   1.  A full-pointer register value (notionally a pointer into an
        array of 16-bit deltas)
    2.  A base address register value added to a 16-bit delta-offset
        located in the msbs of a third source register value.

Data format:

:   -   Results are:
        -   A new pair of 16-bit deltas
        -   A naturally aligned 32-bit data value, written to the
            destination register

Address auto-increment:

:   -   The full pointer register is post-incremented by 4 (bytes)
