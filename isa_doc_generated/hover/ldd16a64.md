* `ldd16a64 $aDst0:Dst0+1, $mAddr0++, $mBase0, $mDelta0@`

Post-incrementing 16-bit delta load with simultaneous 64-bit data load.

Destination register-file: Combination of MRF and ARF

Effective addresses:

:   1.  A full-pointer value (`$m` register)
    2.  Base address (`$m` register) plus 16-bit, unsigned address delta
        (`$m` register)

Data format:

:   1.  A 16-bit value (new delta-offset) written to the MRF delta
        register.
    2.  A 64-bit value written to the ARF destination register pair.

Address auto-increment:

:   1.  The full-pointer source register value is incremented by 2
        (bytes).
