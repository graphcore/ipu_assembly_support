* `ld64a32 $aDst0+1:Dst0+3, $mAddr0++, $mBase0, $mDelta0`

Post-incrementing load of dense 64-bit value plus a sparse 32-bit value.

Destination register-file: ARF only

Effective addresses:

:   1.  A full-pointer register value (notionally a pointer into an
        array of dense values).
    2.  A base address register value added to a 16-bit delta-offset
        located in the lsbs of a third source register value.

Data format:

:   -   Results are:
        -   A naturally aligned 64-bit value, written to the top half of
            the destination register quad.
        -   A naturally aligned 32-bit data value, written to the 2nd
            element of the destination register quad.

Address auto-increment:

:   -   The full-pointer register is post-incremented by 8 (bytes)

## Note

The first element of the destination register quad is unmodified.
