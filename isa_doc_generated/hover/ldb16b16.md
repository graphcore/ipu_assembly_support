* `ldb16b16 $aDst0:Dst0+1, $mBase0, $mDelta0++, $mMiniD0&gt;&gt;`

Broadcast 16-bit load from base + 16-bit delta-offset with 2nd broadcast
16-bit load from base plus 2nd 16-bit delta-offset.

Destination register-file: ARF only

Effective addresses:

:   -   2 load addresses provided directly from MRF as a common base
        register plus independent 16-bit delta-offsets (packed into a
        single MRF register)

Data format:

:   -   Results are 2 x *f16v2* values stored in a naturally aligned
        register pair. Each *f16v2* vector is created from a broadcast
        operation on a single 16-bit value loaded from *Tile Memory*.

Address auto-increment:

:   -   The two 16-bit delta-offsets are post-incremented independently:
        -   One is incremented by 2 (bytes)
        -   The other is incremented according to the 4-bit mini-delta
            value in the lsbs of the 4th operand.
    -   The mini-delta operand is also right-shifted by 4.
