* `ldd16b16 $aDst0, $mAddr0++, $mBase0, $mDelta0@`

Post-incrementing 16-bit delta load with simultaneous broadcast 16-bit
data load.

Destination register-file: Combination of MRF and ARF

Effective addresses:

:   1.  A full-pointer value (`$m` register)
    2.  Base address (`$m` register) plus 16-bit, unsigned address delta
        (`$m` register)

Data format:

:   1.  A 16-bit value (new delta-offset) written to the MRF delta
        register.
    2.  A 32-bit value formed via a broadcast operation on the 16-bit
        loaded data value written to the ARF destination register.

Address auto-increment:

:   1.  The full-pointer source register value is incremented by 2
        (bytes).
